# Pandas-Based ETL Pipeline
This project is a modular Python pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads raw CSV data using pandas. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and serves as a foundation for more advanced data engineering projects. The pipeline is class-based and designed for maintainability and scalability.

## Features
- Extract data from CSV files
- Transform and clean data by removing empty/null/invalid values and converting data types
- Load processed data back to CSV
- Modular architecture for maintainability
- Easy to extend for databases or cloud storage

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
    clone repo
    cd pandas_based_etl_pipeline

2. **Create virtual environment**
    python -m venv venv

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

4. **Install dependencies:**
    pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Configure your source and destination CSV files in config.json:**
    {
        "source": "data/raw/dirty_data_demo.csv",
        "destination": "data/cleaned/cleaned_data_demo.csv"
    }

6. **Run the pipeline:**
    python pipeline.py
